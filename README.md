Ilesta

Ilesta is a de novo genome assembler for long reads based on the Overlap–Layout–Consensus (OLC) approach. It is under active development.
This tool aims to process long-read sequencing data, identify high-quality overlaps between reads, and construct an assembly graph for downstream layout and consensus steps.
